        <p class="page-hero__subhead">Most fabrication shops are losing 5-15% of revenue to margin leakage they can't see. The Manufacturing Profit Recovery audit finds it, measures it, and gives you a plan to fix it.</p>

        <h2>The Manufacturing Profit Recovery Audit</h2>
        <p class="hero__deck" style="margin-bottom:var(--space-md)">A 4-6 week, fixed-fee engagement that shows you exactly where your shop is losing money — and what to do about it.</p>

        <div class="content-block" style="margin-bottom:var(--space-lg)">
          <p>Your margins should match your effort. When they don't, the gap is hiding somewhere in your operation — in the quotes, the schedule, the overtime, the rework, the bottlenecks. Somewhere between the jobs coming in the door and the checks going out, money is leaking.</p>
          <p>The Manufacturing Profit Recovery audit finds those leaks. Not with theory. Not with a methodology deck. With a hands-on, financial-first review of how your shop actually runs — conducted by someone who's led operations like yours for 25 years.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What the Audit Examines</h3>
        <div class="examine-list">
          <div class="examine-list__item">
            <span class="examine-list__label">Job costing accuracy</span> — Are your actual costs matching your estimates? Where are the biggest gaps?
          </div>
          <div class="examine-list__item">
            <span class="examine-list__label">Quoting practices</span> — Are you pricing to win or pricing to profit? Where are you consistently underbidding?
          </div>
          <div class="examine-list__item">
            <span class="examine-list__label">Scheduling and throughput</span> — Where are jobs stalling? What bottlenecks are rippling through the whole floor?
          </div>
          <div class="examine-list__item">
            <span class="examine-list__label">Overtime patterns</span> — Is overtime strategic or reactive? What's it actually costing you per month?
          </div>
          <div class="examine-list__item">
            <span class="examine-list__label">Scrap and rework rates</span> — How much material and labor is getting lost to do-overs and waste?
          </div>
          <div class="examine-list__item">
            <span class="examine-list__label">Labor utilization</span> — Are your people spending time on value-adding work, or fighting the system?
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>What You Get</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom:var(--space-sm)">A detailed report with three parts:</p>
        <div class="deliverable-list">
          <div class="deliverable-list__item">
            <span class="deliverable-list__label">Where the money is going</span> — Every margin leak identified and measured in dollars, not percentages. You'll see the actual financial impact of each issue.
          </div>
          <div class="deliverable-list__item">
            <span class="deliverable-list__label">Why it's happening</span> — The root cause behind each leak, not just the symptom. Overtime isn't the problem — it's a symptom of something upstream.
          </div>
          <div class="deliverable-list__item">
            <span class="deliverable-list__label">What to fix and in what order</span> — A prioritized action plan ranked by financial impact. The biggest dollars-recovered-per-effort items go first.

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>Stu comes to your shop. He works on your floor and in your books — not from a conference room. He works around your production schedule. No all-hands meetings. No workshops. No pulling your people off the line.</p>
          <p>The audit takes 4-6 weeks. You pay a fixed fee agreed on upfront. No hourly billing. No scope creep. No surprise invoices.</p>
          <p>At the end, you'll know exactly where your margin is going and what it's worth to fix it. What you do with that information is up to you — but most shops recover 3-5x the audit fee within 12 months. On a $5 million operation, that often means six figures back in your pocket. <a href="faq.html" class="text-link">Common questions about the audit &rarr;</a></p>

        <h2>Help Fixing What the Audit Finds</h2>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p><strong>The audit tells you what to fix. If you want help fixing it, Stu can stay.</strong></p>
          <p>Implementation support is a flexible engagement built around the audit's action plan. Stu works alongside your team to execute the highest-impact changes — adjusting quoting models, redesigning scheduling workflows, setting up job-cost tracking that actually gets used, reducing overtime through better planning.</p>
          <p>This isn't project management from a laptop. It's hands-on work with your people, on your floor, solving the specific problems the audit identified.</p>
          <p>Engagement length depends on the scope of changes. Some shops need four weeks. Some need four months. The work is scoped and priced before it starts — no open-ended retainers.</p>

        <h2>A Seasoned Operations Leader — Without the Six-Figure Salary</h2>
        <div class="content-block" style="margin-bottom:var(--space-md)">
          <p>Some shops don't need a full-time COO. They need someone who's been one — available when it counts.</p>
          <p>Think of it as having an experienced operations leader on call — someone who knows your shop, knows your numbers, and can help you make the right call when the stakes are high.</p>

        <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
        <div class="content-block" style="margin-bottom:var(--space-lg)">
          <p>We don't do Lean certification workshops. We don't audit your 5S compliance. We don't sell you software and call it consulting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bold-lead">
          <strong>Not methodology theater.</strong>
          <p>We don't come in with a pre-built framework and force your operation into it. We start with your numbers and your shop. The approach fits the operation — not the other way around.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bold-lead">
          <strong>Not an ERP pitch.</strong>
          <p>We're not a software company with a consulting arm. If your ERP needs work, we'll tell you — but we're not selling you a system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bold-lead">
          <strong>Not hourly billing.</strong>
          <p>Hourly billing rewards slow work. Every IronForge engagement has a fixed fee and a fixed timeline. You know what you're paying before we start.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bold-lead">
          <strong>Not a binder on a shelf.</strong>
          <p>The audit deliverable is built to be used, not filed. Specific dollar amounts. Specific fixes. Specific priorities. If you can't act on it, we didn't do our job.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bold-lead">
          <strong>Not theory from someone who's never run a shop.</strong>
          <p>Stu started as a welder. He led fabrication operations for 25 years. He's not going to tell you how to run your operation from a textbook. <a href="about.html" class="text-link">Learn about Stu's background &rarr;</a></p>
