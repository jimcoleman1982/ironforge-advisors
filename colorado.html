            <p>Stu Jensen has spent his entire career in Colorado manufacturing. He's led fabrication operations across the state for over 25 years. He knows the labor pool, the supply chains, the seasonal patterns, and the specific challenges that come with running a shop here.</p>
            <p>That means he already understands your market before he walks through your door. He knows what it takes to recruit a good welder along the Front Range. He knows why material lead times hit different when you're a thousand miles from the nearest port. He's dealt with the same workforce shortages, the same pricing pressure, and the same customer expectations you're dealing with right now.</p>
            <p>Working exclusively in Colorado isn't a limitation. It's a deliberate focus. <a href="about.html" class="text-link">Stu</a> knows your region, your industry peers, and the operating conditions you deal with every day. He's not flying in from out of state to learn your market on your dime. He's already here. He's been here. And that means the <a href="services.html" class="text-link">Profit Recovery audit</a> starts with real knowledge of your environment, not a generic playbook borrowed from a shop in Ohio.</p>
