              <p>That's the most common thing Stu hears. And usually, the story is the same: someone came in with a methodology, produced a report, and left. Nothing changed. IronForge is different because Stu starts with your financials, not a framework. The deliverable shows specific dollar amounts, not theory. And if you want help implementing the fixes, he's there to do it. On the floor, not from a conference room.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>No. This isn't Lean certification, Six Sigma training, or 5S workshops. There's nothing wrong with those tools in the right context, but they're not what IronForge does. The Profit Recovery audit is financial-first. It starts with where you're losing money and works backward to the operational causes. If a Lean principle happens to be the right fix, great. But we're not selling a methodology.</p>

            <div class="faq-item__answer">
              <p>Then you'll know. And that's worth knowing. But in Stu's experience, even well-run shops have blind spots. The audit has never come back empty. There's always something hiding.</p>

              <p>It depends on what the audit finds. It could mean rebuilding your quoting model, redesigning production scheduling, setting up job-cost tracking, or working with your team to fix a specific bottleneck. It's scoped and priced separately, based on the action plan.</p>
