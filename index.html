          <span class="lead__opener">You're not imagining it.</span>
          <p>You're running more jobs than last year. You're busier than you've ever been. But when you look at the bank account, the numbers don't match the effort.</p>
          <p>That gap between effort and earnings? That's margin leaking out of your operation in places you can't see from the floor.</p>
          <p><strong>Most fabrication shops are losing 5-15% of revenue to hidden leakage:</strong> bad quotes, overtime creep, scrap nobody's tracking, bottlenecks that ripple through every job. On a $5 million operation, that's $250,000 to $750,000 walking out the door every year.</p>
          <p>It adds up quietly. And the longer it runs, the more it costs you.</p>
          <p>The Manufacturing Profit Recovery audit finds exactly where that money is going, and gives you a plan to get it back.</p>

    <!-- Problem Identification -->
    <section class="section section--alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Does This Sound Like Your Shop?</h2>
        <div class="problem-list">
          <div class="problem-list__item">You're working harder than ever, but margins keep getting thinner, and you can't pinpoint why</div>
          <div class="problem-list__item">Overtime is creeping up, but production isn't keeping pace</div>
          <div class="problem-list__item">You're quoting jobs from experience and gut feel, hoping you're not leaving money on the table</div>
          <div class="problem-list__item">Every job feels like a fire drill. There's no system, just you putting out fires</div>
          <div class="problem-list__item">Your best machinist or welder carries knowledge that lives in their head and nowhere else</div>
          <div class="problem-list__item">You've thought about hiring a consultant, but the last thing you need is someone with a clipboard telling you what you already know</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>If you've been burned by consultants before, or you've just been trying to figure it out yourself because nobody else understands your business, you're not wrong to be skeptical.</p>
          <p>Most manufacturing consulting is exactly what you think it is: expensive theory from people who've never run a shop.</p>
          <p><strong>This isn't that.</strong></p>

    <!-- The Approach -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>How the Manufacturing Profit Recovery Audit Works</h2>
        <p class="hero__deck" style="margin-bottom:var(--space-lg)">A 4-6 week, fixed-fee deep dive into your operation and your financials. Practical answers, not theory, and zero disruption to your production.</p>

        <div class="steps">
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step__number">01</span>
            <h3 class="step__title">Stu Comes to Your Shop</h3>
            <p class="step__text">He walks your floor, reviews your financials, and studies your job costing, quoting, scheduling, and throughput. He works around your production schedule. No workshops, no off-sites, no pulling people off the floor.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step__number">02</span>
            <h3 class="step__title">He Finds Where the Money Is Going</h3>
            <p class="step__text">Quoting inaccuracies. Overtime patterns nobody's tracking. Scrap and rework that doesn't show up on a P&amp;L. Scheduling gaps that create bottlenecks. The stuff that's been eating your margin for years, quietly and invisibly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step__number">03</span>
            <h3 class="step__title">You Get a Clear Report and Action Plan</h3>
            <p class="step__text">A detailed report showing exactly where margin is leaking, with dollar amounts, and a prioritized list of fixes ranked by financial impact. You'll know what to fix first and what it's worth.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="not-list">
          <div class="not-list__item">Not Lean certification theater</div>
          <div class="not-list__item">Not an ERP sales pitch disguised as consulting</div>
          <div class="not-list__item">Not hourly billing that rewards slow work</div>
          <div class="not-list__item">Not a six-month engagement with no clear deliverable</div>
        </div>

        <p class="tagline">Fixed fee. Fixed timeline. Clear deliverable. No surprises.</p>

    <!-- Why Stu -->
    <section class="section section--alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Built from the Floor Up</h2>
        <div class="stu-intro">
          <img src="images/stu-shop-floor.jpg" alt="Stu Jensen standing on a CNC machine shop floor" class="stu-photo" width="360" height="480" loading="lazy">
          <div class="content-block">
            <p>Stu Jensen didn't go to business school and decide to consult. He started as a machine operator, worked his way up to supervisor, plant manager, and General Manager of Sales and Operations, and spent 25 years leading fabrication operations from the floor up.</p>
            <p>He's managed operations from 10 to 40+ employees. He's quoted jobs, built schedules, hired and fired, dealt with equipment breakdowns at 4 AM, and covered for the guy who didn't show up on a Monday. He's made every mistake a manufacturing leader can make, and learned from every one of them.</p>
            <p>After four decades in manufacturing, Stu kept seeing the same thing: good shops bleeding profit in places the owner couldn't see. Not because they were bad operators. Because they were too deep in the day-to-day to step back and look at the numbers.</p>
            <p><strong>That's why he started IronForge Advisors.</strong> Not to tell shop owners how to run their business, but to show them where the money is going.</p>
